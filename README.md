# jquery-and-WP-REST-API-Slider-NG-Slider
A simple script that utilizes jQuery and the WP-REST API to generate an efficient and simple slider.

Nothing special here, really. Customize it to suit your needs and follow the comments in the .js file to guide you. Happy scripting. Hate mail at there being yet another slide up on GitHub can be directed to https://classicwfl.com. Thanks!
